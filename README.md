# Welcome Space Force! ðŸš€

Thanks for evaluating my CRUD Application. Looking forward to earning the Z-Prefix!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:
- Docker Desktop installed and running on your machine

You can install Docker Desktop by visiting the [Docker Website](https://app.docker.com/)

This is the current web URL as of January 2025.

## Quick Start

To launch the application after installing and running Docker Desktop, simply execute:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

> Note: The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode (background), allowing continued use of your terminal.

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

To monitor the application or check for errors:
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Navigate to the Containers section
3. Locate the Supra Coder container
4. View real-time application logs

Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
